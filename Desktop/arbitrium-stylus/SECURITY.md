- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

### Security Measures

The Arbitrum Stylus IDE implements several security measures:

#### Sandboxed Execution
- All WASM modules run in isolated Wasmer environments
- No network access from contract execution
- Limited system resource access
- Memory and execution time limits

#### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- WASM bytecode is verified before execution
- Function parameters are type-checked

#### Secure Defaults
- Minimal privilege execution
- Secure configuration defaults
- No sensitive data in logs

#### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning of dependencies
- Minimal dependency footprint

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Investigation**: We investigate all reports thoroughly
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test fixes
3. **Coordinated Release**: We coordinate release timing with reporters
4. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose vulnerabilities after fixes are available
5. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit to reporters (if desired)

### Security Best Practices for Users

#### For Developers
